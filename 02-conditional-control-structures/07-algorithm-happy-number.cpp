/*
A 4-digit number is happy if the first two digits are greater than the last two digits. For example 5612 is happy because 56 is greater than 12. A 4-digit number is increasing if each digit is greater than the previous digit.
For example 1569 is increasing because 9 > 6 > 5 > 1. Any number that is happy and increasing is said to be a very happy number. Any number that is neither happy nor increasing is said to be unhappy.
Make an algorithm that takes as input a 4-digit number and prints the type of number found, according to the described classification.
